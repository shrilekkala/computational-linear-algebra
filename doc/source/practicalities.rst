Practical matters
=================

Lecturer
--------

The module is led by `Prof Colin Cotter
<http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/colin.cotter>`_, a Professor of
Computational Mathematics who uses and researches computational linear
algebra tools in the course of his work on computational methods for
partial differential equations, computational image registration and
data assimilation.

Accreditation
-------------

This module is an accredited elective for third and fourth year
mathematics and JMC undergraduates. It is also approved for the `MSc
in Applied Mathematics
<http://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/courses/mathematics/applied-mathematics/>`_,
`MRes in Mathematics of Planet Earth <http://mpecdt.org>`_, and for
second and third year PhD students in the `CDT in Fluid Dynamics
Across Scales <http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/fluidscdt>`_. Other masters
and PhD students wishing to take the module should contact the
course lecturer in the first instance.

Assumed knowledge
-----------------

The theory component of the module will assume only a familiarity with
undergraduate linear algebra. The implementation will be in Python, a
very high level and simple language with similarities to
Matlab. Students who are not familiar with Python will need to acquire
some familiarity with the language, for example by doing one of the
suggested tutorials.


Assessment
----------

The module will be assessed by submission of two courseworks, each
comprising a pdf report and a code submission. The first will be worth
20%, with feedback provided to students that they can use to help with
the second coursework, worth 80%.

Mastery
.......

All Department of Mathematics fourth year and masters courses must
contain a mastery component. This part of the course is only for
completion by those students: third year students are exempt.
The mastery component of this module will be an additional
coursework based on additional material.

Blackboard
----------

Important announcements and the coursework submission will be conducted
via Blackboard. Please ensure you are enrolled in this module on Blackboard!
